## Use read.table for moderately sized datasets
```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

data <- read.table("foo.txt")

```

## Setting rows doesnt make R run faster but helps with memory management/usage
```{r}
    initial <- read.table("datatable.txt", nrows = 100)
    classes <- sapply(initial, class)
    tabAll <- read.table("datatable.txt", colClasses = classes)
```
