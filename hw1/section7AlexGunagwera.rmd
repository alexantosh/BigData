# 7.Using the readr Package
```{r}
setwd('C:/Program Files/R')
library(readr)
teams <- read_csv("C:/Program Files/R/team_standings.csv")
```
## For some reason most of the team file operations were unsuccesful due to missing files so I used my own. But for consistency I will post the original
```{r}
teams
```

### This File was not found - useda different one
```{r}
teams <- read_csv("C:/Program Files/R/team_standings.csv",col_types="cc")
```
 
 
```{r}
logs <- read_csv("C:/Program Files/R/team_standings.csv", n_max = 10)

```
